How tall are you?

For example, if you tell someone that you are about five feet tall, that 
wouldn't be very precise. If you told someone that you are 62 inches tall, that 
would be more precise. If you told someone that you are 62.3 inches tall, that 
would be even more precise, and if you told someone that you are 62.37 inches 
tall, that would be very precise for a measurement of that nature.

The smaller the unit...

</emphasis>
</para>




<para id="p1027">
The smaller the unit you use to measure with, the more precise the 
measurement can be. For example, assume that you measure someone's height with a 
tactile measuring stick that is longer than the person is tall. Assume also that 
the measuring stick is graduated only in feet. In that case, the best that you 
could hope for would be to get the measurement correct to the nearest foot and 
perhaps estimate a second digit to the nearest tenth of a foot.

One-inch graduations

</emphasis>
</para>




<para id="p1029">
On the other hand, if the measuring stick is graduated in inches and you are 
careful, you should be able to get the measurement correct to the nearest inch 
and perhaps estimate another digit to the nearest tenth of an inch. The second 
measurement using the one-inch graduations would be more precise than the first 
using the one-foot graduations.

Diminishing returns

</para>




<para id="p1031">
If the measuring stick were graduated in tenth-inch units, however, 
that may or may not lead to a more precise measurement. That would be 
approaching the point of diminishing returns where your inability to take full 
advantage of the more precise graduations and the inability of the subject to 
always stand with the same degree of rigidity might come into play.

<para id="p1032">
According to 

<link id="a1036" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_notation">


Wikipedia

, scientific notation is a way of writing numbers that accommodates values too large or small to be conveniently written in standard decimal notation. 
The notation has a number of useful properties and is commonly used by scientists and engineers. 
A variation of scientific notation is also used internally by computers.

In normalized notation the exponent is negative for a number with absolute value between 0 and 1.

Significant figures

</emphasis>


</title>




<para id="p1060">
According to 

<link id="a1037" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Significant_figures">


Wikipedia

</link>

, The significant figures of a number are those digits that carry meaning contributing to its precision. This includes all digits except:

</para>




<list id="ul1011" list-type="bulleted">

	

<item id="li1045">
Leading zeros where they serve merely as placeholders to indicate the scale of the number 
	(.00356 for example).

</item>


	

<item id="li1046">
Spurious digits introduced, for example, by calculations carried out to greater accuracy than that of the original data, or measurements reported to a greater precision than the equipment supports.

</item>




</list>




<para id="p1061">
A popular physics textbook provides a more complete set of rules for identifying the 
significant figures in a number:

</para>




<list id="ol1000" list-type="enumerated">

	

<item id="li1047">
Nonzero digits are always significant.

</item>


	

<item id="li1048">
Final or ending zeros written to the right of the decimal point are significant.

</item>


	

<item id="li1049">
Zeros written to the right of the decimal point for the purpose of spacing the
decimal point are not significant.

</item>


	

<item id="li1050">
Zeros written to the left of the decimal point may be significant, or they may
only be there to space the decimal point. For example, 200 cm could have one,
two, or three significant figures; it's not clear whether the distance was measured
to the nearest 1 cm, to the nearest 10 cm, or to the nearest 100 cm. On
the other hand, 200.0 cm has four significant figures (see rule 5). Rewriting the
number in scientific notation is one way to remove the ambiguity.

</item>

Zeros written between significant figures are significant.

<para id="p1063">
Again, according to


<link id="a1038" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_notation">

Wikipedia

</link>

, it is customary in scientific measurements to record all the significant digits from the measurements, and to guess one additional digit if there is any information at all available to the observer to make a guess. The resulting number is considered more valuable than it would be without that extra digit, and it is considered a significant digit because it contains some information leading to greater precision in measurements and in aggregations of measurements (adding them or multiplying them together).

I encourage you to run the scripts that I have presented in this lesson to
