<para id="p1008">
As a young engineering student many years ago, I was told that when 
evaluating mathematical expressions, I should always embed the units in the 
expression, manipulate them algebraically, and confirm that the units that 
survive until the end of the evaluation are correct relative to the problem 
specifications.

It shows what the units of the result are. A common mistake is to get the correct numerical result of a calculation but to write it with the wrong units.

</item>


	

<item id="li1050">
It shows where unit conversions must be performed. If units that should have canceled do not 
	cancel, we need to go back and perform the necessary conversions. For 
	example, when a speed in miles per hour is being calculated and the result 
	comes out with units of miles per second, we should convert seconds to hours.

</item>


	

<item id="li1051">
It helps to locate mistakes. If a velocity (meters per second) is being calculated and the units come out as 
	seconds per meter, we know to look for an error.

A significant disadvantage

</emphasis>
</para>




<para id="p1012">
This is an area where blind students may be at a significant disadvantage 
relative to sighted students due mainly to the fact that blind students using 
screen readers and Braille displays can only see one line of text at a time. It 
is much easier (for me anyway) to correctly manipulate the units when the 
expression is written on two or more lines.

Multiple-line format

</emphasis>
</para>




<para id="p1014">
What I mean by this is that a sighted student would typically write a 
fraction as a horizontal line with the numerator above the line and the 
denominator below the line using superscripts to indicate exponents. The product of two fractions would typically be 
written in the same format with a multiplication indicator joining the two 
fractions.

However, we must work with what we are given so the mathematical

that the single-line format can usually be easily translated into a format that 
is suitable for evaluation using JavaScript.

What do we mean by units?

<para id="p1020">
Let me try to answer this important question with an example.

</para>




<para id="p1021">
If you were to walk from your home to your school and count your steps, you 
might report that the distance from your home to your school is 2112 steps or paces. If 
you are a male student, this would probably be approximately one mile, using 
assumptions that I will explain later. If you are a female, it would probably be 
somewhat less than a mile because your pace would probably be a little shorter 
than your male friend's pace.

</para>




<para id="p1022">
<emphasis id="strong1005" effect="bold">
A pace is a unit of measurement

</emphasis>
</para>




<para id="p1023">
In this case, the pace would be a unit of measurement. However, it would not 
be a standard unit because the length of a pace for one student is often 
different from the length of a pace for a different student. A male student, for 
example, typically has a longer pace length than a female student.

<para id="p1024">

Standard units

</emphasis>
</para>




<para id="p1025">
Standard units are units whose value has been set by some official agency 
that has the authority to set standards. One such standard unit is the mile, 
which as you may know is equal to 5280 foots (more correctly pronounced feet).

</para>




<para id="p1026">
A foot is also a standard unit, which you may also know is equal to 12 
inches. An inch is another standard unit.

 is an example of the need for more consistency in the use of units. Many 
physics books use a system of units called 

<emphasis id="strong1009" effect="bold">

French name, which I am unable to pronounce, and
